DP 900 Study Notes

What is data?
Data is a collection of facts such as numbers, descriptions, and observations used in decision making. You can classify data as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

Semi-structured data is information that doesn't reside in a relational database but still has some structure to it. Examples include documents held in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

There are other types of semi-structured data as well. Examples include key-value stores and graph databases.
A key-value store is similar to a relational table, except that each row can have any number of columns. The image below shows an example of key-value data.
