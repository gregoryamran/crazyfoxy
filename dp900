What is data?
Data is a collection of facts such as numbers, descriptions, and observations used in decision making. You can classify data as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

Semi-structured data is information that doesn't reside in a relational database but still has some structure to it. Examples include documents held in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

There are other types of semi-structured data as well. Examples include key-value stores and graph databases.
A key-value store is similar to a relational table, except that each row can have any number of columns. The image below shows an example of key-value data.

How is data defined, stored, and accessed in cloud computing?
Depending on the type of data such as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, data will be stored differently. Structured data is typically stored in a relational database such as SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. Azure SQL Database is a service that runs in the cloud. You can use it to create and access relational tables. The service is managed and run by Azure, you just specify that you want a database server to be created. The act of setting up the database server is called provisioning.


What is a transactional system?

A transactional system is often what most people consider the primary function of business computing. A transactional system records transactions. A transaction could be financial, such as the movement of money between accounts in a banking system, or it might be part of a retail system, tracking payments for goods and services from customers. Think of a transaction as a small, discrete, unit of work.
Transactional systems are often high-volume, sometimes handling many millions of transactions in a single day. The data being processed has to be accessible very quickly. The work performed by transactional systems is often referred to as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP).

Splitting tables out into separate groups of columns like this is called normalized. The next unit discusses this process in more detail. Normalization can enable a transactional system to cache much of the information required to perform transactions in memory, and speed throughput.


What is an analytical system?

In contrast to systems designed to support OLTP, an analytical system is designed to support business users who need to query data and gain a big picture view of the information held in a database.

Analytical systems are concerned with capturing raw data, and using it to generate insights. An organization can use these insights to make business decisions. For example, detailed insights for a manufacturing company might indicate trends enabling them to determine which product lines to focus on, for profitability.

Most analytical data processing systems need to perform similar tasks: data ingestion, data transformation, data querying, and data visualization. The image below illustrates the components in a typical data processing system.

Data Ingestion: Data ingestion is the process of capturing the raw data. This data could be taken from control devices measuring environmental information such as temperature and pressure, point-of-sale devices recording the items purchased by a customer in a supermarket, financial data recording the movement of money between bank accounts, and weather data from weather stations. Some of this data might come from a separate OLTP system. To process and analyze this data, you must first store the data in a repository of some sort. The repository could be a file store, a document database, or even a relational database.

Data Transformation/Data Processing: The raw data might not be in a format that is suitable for querying. The data might contain anomalies that should be filtered out, or it may require transforming in some way. For example, dates or addresses might need to be converted into a standard format. After data is ingested into a data repository, you may want to do some cleaning operations and remove any questionable or invalid data, or perform some aggregations such as calculating profit, margin, and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are how businesses are measured for growth and performance.

Data Querying: After data is ingested and transformed, you can query the data to analyze it. You may be looking for trends, or attempting to determine the cause of problems in your systems. Many database management systems provide tools to enable you to perform ad-hoc queries against your data and generate regular reports.

Data Visualization: Data represented in tables such as rows and columns, or as documents, aren't always intuitive. Visualizing the data can often be useful as a tool for examining data. You can generate charts such as bar charts, line charts, plot results on geographical maps, pie charts, or illustrate how data changes over time. Microsoft offers visualization tools like Power BI to provide rich graphical representation of your data.
